All the app logos/ branding should be placed inside `./assets/` folder.

All internal icons/ images should be placed as usual, inside `./src/assets/`

#### Manifest

The `manifest.js` file wil include all your configurations for the app.

**In Dev:**

- `npm run serve` will build `manifest.json` from the manifest.js file for local dev.
  The entry path will be localhost:4000.

**In Prod:**

  The entry path will be the actual path. Ex: `assets/index.html`.

Parameters can also be added depending on dev or production in `manifest.js` file
