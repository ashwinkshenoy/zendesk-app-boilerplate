## ü§òüèª Introduction

The scope of this project is a to have a ready to go app boilerplate to start building zendesk apps using:

- VueJS

> **Note:**
> Vuex/Pinia can also be added following the vuex installation guidelines using `npm`

<br />

## üñ• Development

This boilerplate has been built on top of vue-cli scaffold, for easier future upgrades.

### Local setup

Add a `./config.json` file in root
Ex:

```json
{
  "IS_PRODUCTION": false
}
```

To initilaze local development do:

```
npm run install
```

To start development server do:

```
npm run serve
```

HMR (Hot Module Reload) is available for all the files.
You need to restart the server for changes made to `manifest.js` file.

To build for production do:

```
npm run build
```

(all files will be available in `dist/` folder including the zip file `dist/tmp/project.zip` folder)

If you wish to use yarn, do replace `npm` with `yarn` in package.json `serve` & `build` commands.

<br />

## üõ† Settings

### Assets

All the app logos/ branding should be placed inside `./assets/` folder.

All internal icons/ images should be placed as usual, inside `./src/assets/`

<br />

### Manifest

The `manifest.js` file wil include all your configurations for the app.

**In Dev:**
`npm run serve` will build `manifest.json` from the manifest.js file for local dev.
The entry path will be localhost:4000.

**In Prod:**
`npm run build` will build `manifest.json` from the manifest.js file for production.
The entry path will be the actual path. Ex: `assets/index.html`.

Parameters can also be added depending on dev or production in `manifest.js` file

<br />

### Parameters

`IS_PRODUCTION`:

Looking at the `manifest.js` file you may notice the presence of the parameter `IS_PRODUCTION`.
This hidden parameter will help you when you work `secure` settings.

```json
{
  "name": "IS_PRODUCTION",
  "type": "hidden",
  "default": "true"
}
```

**Note:**
This trick will only work if you run `zat server -c config.json`

<br />

`CLIENT` - this is object is the key point of your app that allows you to communicate
with Zendesk. Keep this object as **private** and expose only `getters` and `setter`
you need to make your app working. Same approach could be used for objects like `APP_SETTINGS` and you could also include `CURRENT_TICKET`, `CURRENT_USER` etc.

`events` - Here is where you collect all the events your app is going to listen to.
By default you have `APP_REGISTERED` which is the event that first fires once `ZAFClient.init()` is called. By passing a `callback` function, you will be able
to handles the response from wherever you want in the code. (See main.js for as example)

**Note:** These are ment to be only suggestions and not a must have.
